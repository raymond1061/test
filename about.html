    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
        <p>I was born in New Jersey, but moved to Louisiana by the time I was 2, and lived the swamp life until the age of 7. Then I moved to where I'm currently living, which is sunny Las Vegas, where you'll need a jacket for mornings, and have a heat stroke by midday if you're not careful.</p>
